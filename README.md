# Queue
This is a linked-list implementation of a Queue. Basically, a queue is a linear data structure in which the insertion and deletion operations are performed in two different ends. The insertion (**enqueue**) is a push to the rear while the deletion is a deletion (**dequeue**) from the front. for more info of the queue abstract data type, click [here](http://btechsmartclass.com/DS/U2_T7.html).

## Sorting
 - FIFO (First in, First out) so the one who comes earlier, leaves earlier :)

## Operations
 - enqueue (add/push to the back)
 - dequeue (pop/remove from the front)
 - front
 - rear
 - is_empty
 - clear

## How to Run?

```
gcc -o queue queue.c
chmod +r queue
./queue
```
